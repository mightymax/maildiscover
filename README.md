# Maildiscover service

## Intended audience/users
* Sysadmins hosting their own mailservers
* Sysadmins hosting Nextcloud or other CardDAV/CalDAV servers
* Sysadmins having a Php stack available in their webserver

## Intro
After trying several solutions for hosting and serving config files that allow mailusers to have their mailclients automatically setup their mail connections, I was frustrated with the complexity and lack of support for environments I feel comfortable working with (basically Php and nginx). Since my webhosting stack also includes Nextcloud and being an Apple user, I also wanted to add support for CardDAV and CalDAV in the Apple profiles.
